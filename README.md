# Testing-for-Animation-Zoom

🚀 Project Highlight: Website Functionality and Compatibility Testing for Animation Zoom 🎬

I had the opportunity to lead the manual testing for Animation Zoom, a website providing dynamic animated content and services. The project focused on ensuring a seamless user experience, optimal performance, and cross-browser/device compatibility.

Key Contributions: ✔️ Conducted in-depth testing of core features, UI/UX, and performance
✔️ Ensured 100% compatibility across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and mobile devices (iOS, Android)
✔️ Identified and resolved UI/UX inconsistencies, reducing critical defects by 25% before launch
✔️ Performed detailed performance checks to optimize speed and responsiveness

Thanks to the collaborative effort of the team, we achieved a successful, bug-free launch and enhanced user experience. 🎉

Tools Used: Excel/Google Sheets, Jira, GTmetrix, and various mobile browsers.
